#Money Maker
We have three types of coins:

A bronze coin is worth 1 cent
A silver coin is worth 5 cents
A gold coin is worth 10 cents
What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?

It’s a hard question to answer in your head, but it’s a fun problem to solve with programming. 
In this project I’ll use C# to build a Money Maker: a program in which a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.
